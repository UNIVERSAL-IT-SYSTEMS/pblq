INTRODUCTION.
============

This program provides an interface to the PBL boot loader that is present on
the Amstrad E2 and E3 Emailer devices. Its main purpose is to allow the
built-in firmware of the device to be replaced with custom code.


COMPILATION.
===========

pblq is built using Prime Mover. See http://primemover.sf.net for the full
manual.

For a simple build, do:

    ./pm
    
A link to the binary will be produced in the current directory called 'pblq'.
You can copy this where you like using 'cp --L'.

pblq was developed on the Linux i386 platform and while it should be portable,
is not guaranteed to work on other devices --- your mileage may vary. Contact
the author if you have any problems.


USAGE.
=====

	pblq -h

pblq is not a program that should be used if you don't know what you're doing!


LICENSING.
=========

pblq is available under the BSD license. Please see the COPYING file for the
full text.
