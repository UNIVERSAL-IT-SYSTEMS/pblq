INTRODUCTION.
============

This program provides an interface to the PBL boot loader that is present on
the Amstrad E2 and E3 Emailer devices. Its main purpose is to allow the
built-in firmware of the device to be replaced with custom code.

COMPILATION
===========

Run the configure script to generate the Makefile:

	./configure

...and then run the Makefile:

	make

pblq was developed on the Linux i386 platform and while it should be portable,
is not guaranteed to work on other devices --- your mileage may vary. Contact
the author if you have any problems.

USAGE
=====

	pblq -h

pblq is not a program that should be used if you don't know what you're doing!
